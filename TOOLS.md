# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

## 浏览器技术栈原则（2026-04-20确立）

**定时自动任务**：一律用 Playwright 脚本，不依赖 browser-use CLI
- 抖音数据采集 → `douyin_index_v9.py`（Playwright）
- 竞品动态追踪 → `competitor_program_tracker.py`（Playwright）

**browser-use 使用规则**：
- **全面禁止**：包括专属 Chrome 标签页的任何操作，一概拒绝
- **唯一例外**：临时性/没遇到过/复杂的探索任务（新平台/一次性调研），且 Playwright 脚本无法快速覆盖时，才能用
